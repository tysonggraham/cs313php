The chat may have to be taken out. I'm having trouble grabbing the active users.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but signficantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
D/E - I said in between these two because even though I am not pulling out all of the things I wanted from the database, I am pulling a majority of it. I also included some queries into the database to be piped in as variables to the google maps API. I showed creativity and effort but also had one or two things not working in the end so I feel I should get not quite and E but close to it.
